How many passwords do we need to use every single day? At work, online banking, email, shopping. 
And passwords are getting ever more complicated demanding to be changed to 15 alphanumeric digits and a symbol or 8 digits. Then we need to remember the right password for the right situation or we get locked out and computer says no.
Surely there is an easier way.
The big problem with passwords is that they are easy to break even if you only vaguely know what you are doing. Freely available programs use Brute Force and dictionary attacks to break even complex passwords. 
The other problem with passwords is that we like to use the same one over and over again. But this makes us vulnerable to social engineering. A fantastically attractive man/woman is so interested in moi! We can easily end up passing information about our first school where we got bullied, the tragedy of losing our first pet, the story about how my mum met my dad etc. 
If I need a 15 digit password that I must change every two weeks or I get locked out and have to call IT Support and be useless for several hours. Well guess what - I write it down on a post it note under my desk.
