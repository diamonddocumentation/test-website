#### How to Interpret your Test Results

As ZAP spiders your web application, it constructs a map of your web applicationsâ€™ pages
and the resources used to render those pages. Then it records the requests and responses
sent to each page and creates alerts if there is something potentially wrong with a request
or response.

#### Advanced Features

For testing of applications protected using mutual SSL you should generate a Root CA certificate then install it within your browser or HTTP client application.[certificate generation instructions](certificate_generation_and_installation.mdown)
